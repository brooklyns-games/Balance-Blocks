Todo:

- Text dirty render
- 


- Seesaw detects greater than, less than, and equal to 
  - blocks are slipping off
  - add Block only collides with top of deck
  
- Pivot joint on mouse as it picks up block?
- Why are the joints created as sprites?
- Communication between level attributes (weight, blocks) and objects
- Blocks stay as kinematic if you move the mouse too fast when unclicking

Functional but can be optimized
- Find consistent method for handling the stupid pymunk flipped coordinates system
- make sprite groups for collisions/filtering
