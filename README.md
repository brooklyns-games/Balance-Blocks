Todo:
- Pivot joint on mouse as it picks up block
- Add a button to check--you get 3 tries
- system for adding to space is a bit iffy
- Why are the joints created as sprites?
- Todo
- Blocks stay as kinematic if you move the mouse too fast when unclicking

Functional but can be optimized
- Find consistent method for handling the stupid pymunk flipped coordinates system
- make sprite groups for collisions/filtering
